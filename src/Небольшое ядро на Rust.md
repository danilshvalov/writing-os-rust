## Running our Kernel

Now that we have an executable that does something perceptible, it is time to run it. First, we need to turn our compiled kernel into a bootable disk image by linking it with a bootloader. Then we can run the disk image in the [QEMU] virtual machine or boot it on real hardware using a USB stick.

### Creating a Bootimage

To turn our compiled kernel into a bootable disk image, we need to link it with a bootloader. As we learned in the [section about booting], the bootloader is responsible for initializing the CPU and loading our kernel.

[section about booting]: #the-boot-process

Instead of writing our own bootloader, which is a project on its own, we use the [`bootloader`] crate. This crate implements a basic BIOS bootloader without any C dependencies, just Rust and inline assembly. To use it for booting our kernel, we need to add a dependency on it:

[`bootloader`]: https://crates.io/crates/bootloader

```toml
# in Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
bootloader = "0.9.8"
```

Adding the bootloader as dependency is not enough to actually create a bootable disk image. The problem is that we need to link our kernel with the bootloader after compilation, but cargo has no support for [post-build scripts].

[post-build scripts]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/545

To solve this problem, we created a tool named `bootimage` that first compiles the kernel and bootloader, and then links them together to create a bootable disk image. To install the tool, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
cargo install bootimage
```

For running `bootimage` and building the bootloader, you need to have the `llvm-tools-preview` rustup component installed. You can do so by executing `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`.

After installing `bootimage` and adding the `llvm-tools-preview` component, we can create a bootable disk image by executing:

```
> cargo bootimage
```

We see that the tool recompiles our kernel using `cargo build`, so it will automatically pick up any changes you make. Afterwards it compiles the bootloader, which might take a while. Like all crate dependencies it is only built once and then cached, so subsequent builds will be much faster. Finally, `bootimage` combines the bootloader and your kernel to a bootable disk image.

After executing the command, you should see a bootable disk image named `bootimage-blog_os.bin` in your `target/x86_64-blog_os/debug` directory. You can boot it in a virtual machine or copy it to an USB drive to boot it on real hardware. (Note that this is not a CD image, which have a different format, so burning it to a CD doesn't work).

#### How does it work?
The `bootimage` tool performs the following steps behind the scenes:

- It compiles our kernel to an [ELF] file.
- It compiles the bootloader dependency as a standalone executable.
- It links the bytes of the kernel ELF file to the bootloader.

[ELF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format
[rust-osdev/bootloader]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader

When booted, the bootloader reads and parses the appended ELF file. It then maps the program segments to virtual addresses in the page tables, zeroes the `.bss` section, and sets up a stack. Finally, it reads the entry point address (our `_start` function) and jumps to it.

### Booting it in QEMU

We can now boot the disk image in a virtual machine. To boot it in [QEMU], execute the following command:

[QEMU]: https://www.qemu.org/

```
> qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=target/x86_64-blog_os/debug/bootimage-blog_os.bin
warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.01H:ECX.vmx [bit 5]
```

This opens a separate window with that looks like this:

![QEMU showing "Hello World!"](qemu.png)

We see that our "Hello World!" is visible on the screen.

### Real Machine

It is also possible to write it to an USB stick and boot it on a real machine:

```
> dd if=target/x86_64-blog_os/debug/bootimage-blog_os.bin of=/dev/sdX && sync
```

Where `sdX` is the device name of your USB stick. **Be careful** to choose the correct device name, because everything on that device is overwritten.

After writing the image to the USB stick, you can run it on real hardware by booting from it. You probably need to use a special boot menu or change the boot order in your BIOS configuration to boot from the USB stick. Note that it currently doesn't work for UEFI machines, since the `bootloader` crate has no UEFI support yet.

### Using `cargo run`

To make it easier to run our kernel in QEMU, we can set the `runner` configuration key for cargo:

```toml
# in .cargo/config.toml

[target.'cfg(target_os = "none")']
runner = "bootimage runner"
```

The `target.'cfg(target_os = "none")'` table applies to all targets that have set the `"os"` field of their target configuration file to `"none"`. This includes our `x86_64-blog_os.json` target. The `runner` key specifies the command that should be invoked for `cargo run`. The command is run after a successful build with the executable path passed as first argument. See the [cargo documentation][cargo configuration] for more details.

The `bootimage runner` command is specifically designed to be usable as a `runner` executable. It links the given executable with the project's bootloader dependency and then launches QEMU. See the [Readme of `bootimage`] for more details and possible configuration options.

[Readme of `bootimage`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage

Now we can use `cargo run` to compile our kernel and boot it in QEMU.

## What's next?

In the next post, we will explore the VGA text buffer in more detail and write a safe interface for it. We will also add support for the `println` macro.
